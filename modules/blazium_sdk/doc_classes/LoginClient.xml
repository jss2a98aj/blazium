		Node for connecting to the Blazium Login service. Offers authentication mechanism.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [LoginClient] node provides an interface for connecting to the Blazium Login service. There is a free instance hosted on the [url=https://blazium.app]blazium.app[/url] domain that is used by default.
		The authentication flow is as follows:
		1. Listen to all the signals you are interested in.
		2. Connect to the server using the [method connect_to_server] method.
		3. Then you can request login info using the [method request_login_info] method.
		4. Open the resulting login url received after awaiting on the [signal LoginURLResponse.finished] signal.
		5. Obtain the jwt from the [signal received_jwt] signal.
		[b]Note:[/b] Some methods are non blocking and can be awaited in order to get the result.
