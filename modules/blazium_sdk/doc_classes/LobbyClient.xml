		Node for connecting to the Blazium Lobby service. Offers non-authoritative lobby making features.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [LobbyClient] node provides an interface for connecting to the Blazium Lobby service. There is a free instance hosted on the [url=https://blazium.app]blazium.app[/url] domain that is used by default.
		The normal flow is as follows:
		1. Listen to all the signals you are interested in.
		2. Connect to the server using [method connect_to_server] method.
		3. Call any other methods to create, view or join lobbies, as well as add data to them.
		4. Close the session using [method disconnect_from_server] method at the end of the game.
		[b]Note:[/b] Some methods are non blocking and can be awaited in order to get the result.
		There are also members on this class that are automatically updated as the lobby gets updated, such as:
		- [member peer]: The current peer. Reflects changes to the self peer.
		- [member peers]: The lobby peers. Reflects changes to all peers.
		- [member lobby]: The lobby. Reflects changes to the lobby.
		- [member host_data]: The current lobby private data. Only works if you are host.
		- [member peer_data]: The current peer private data.
