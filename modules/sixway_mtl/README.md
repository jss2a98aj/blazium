# 🌫️ Six-Way Volumetric Lighting Shader for Blazium

A **Volumetric Lighting Shader** for Blazium using a **Six-Directional Lighting Model (SDLM)** designed to simulate realistic light interaction within semi-transparent volumes like cloud, smoke, fog and fire as C++ Module.

It's developed with artistic flexibility and lightweight performance in mind, It allows you to simulate light scattering and absorption effects using three precomputed 2D texture maps.

## 🧠 How It Works

Unlike traditional single-source lighting, this shader breaks down the environment lighting into **six principal directions**, combining their influence dynamically in the shader:

- +X / -X
- +Y / -Y
- +Z / -Z

However, instead of using six separate textures, this shader uses **three dual-direction maps**:

- `RTB`: Right (+X), Top (+Y), Back (+Z)
- `LBF`: Left (−X), Bottom (−Y), Front (−Z)
- `TEA`: Transparency, Emission, Ambient Occlusion

These maps are blended based on the light direction at runtime, simulating how light wraps and diffuses through volume.

## 🧰 Usage

1. Add a `MeshInstance3D` node to your scene.
2. Create a new `SixWayLightingMaterial` and assign it to a `MeshInstance3D`.
3. Provide 2D textures for the six-way lighting maps and adjust lighting parameters to taste.
4. Optionally, enable `Billboard` for smoke-like behavior facing the camera.
